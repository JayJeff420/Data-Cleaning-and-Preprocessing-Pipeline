# Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing-Pipeline

Project: Create a comprehensive data cleaning pipeline.
Description: Choose a real-world dataset with common issues like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Demonstrate techniques to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and transforming features.

Project Overview
In this project, we will create a comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline using a real-world dataset. The dataset chosen for this demonstration is the "Titanic" dataset, a widely used dataset for data analysis and machine learning. This dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, and it has common issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Steps for Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data Exploration

Load the dataset.
Understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
Identify common issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Handling Missing Values

Identify columns with missing values.
Decide on the strategy for each column (e.g., imputation, removal).
Apply the chosen strategy to handle missing values.
Removing Duplicates

Check for duplicate records.
Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.
Handling Inconsistencies

Identify and correct inconsistent data entries.
Standardize categorical values.
Feature Engineering

Create new features that might be useful for analysis.
Transform features to improve their relevance.
Data Normalization and Scaling

Normalize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
Apply appropriate scaling techniques.
Final Data Review

Review the cleaned and preprocessed data.
Ensure the dataset is ready for analysis or model training.
